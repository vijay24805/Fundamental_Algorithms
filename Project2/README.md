Implement the randomized incremental algorithm to compute the smallest circle containing
a given set of points in the plane.
You should write a function

◦ void circumcircle(int n, double *pts, double *radius, double *center)


which has as parameters the number of points n and the n × 2 array pts of point coordinates,
as well as a return variable for the resulting radius, and a return vector (pair)
of the resulting circle center coordinates.
